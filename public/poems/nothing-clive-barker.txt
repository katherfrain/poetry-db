Nothing 
By Clive Barker

After a battle lasting many ages,
The Devil won,
And he said to God
(who had been his Maker):
“Lord,
We are about to witness the unmaking of Creation
By my hand.
I would not wish you
to think me cruel,
So I beg you, take three things
From this world before I destroy it.
Three things, and then the rest will be
wiped away.”

God thought for a little time.
And at last He said:
“No, there is nothing.”
The Devil was surprised.
“Not even you, Lord?” he said.
And God said:
“No. Not even me.”
